Put the body of the requisition as JSON. Pass an object with a string date format (dd/MM/yyyy) in the field checkin and checkout. Select the HTTP Method as POST. The server runs at the local port 3000, so the API to check the available rooms between the two dates is http://localhost:3000/buscar. Send the request and wait for the response.
